# Imagzle Game Copy

I played this game in the app Imagzle, it bothered me that I had no undo move button so I programmed this during a flight and included the undo move feature. 

move cursor with 'arrow keys', 'space' to select a tile, press 'r' to reset the board and 'b' to undo move.

red tiles can be selected, when selected moving the arrow keys will make the selected tile blue and the next two tiles in the direction that was pressed will turn red. I believe that the objective of the game is to make the entire board red except for the central tile, but I could be wrong, I know this game as a minigame in an app, I have not solved it yet and I don't know the name of the original name so I haven't found the instructions.

I'm currently trying to let the computer solve it.

The brute force solver is not really finding the solution so another approach will be necessary.
